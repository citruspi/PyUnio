## PyUnio, API Consumption in a Snap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/citruspi/PyUnio.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/citruspi/PyUnio)

__PyUnio is currently in alpha and should not be considered stable.__

### Introducion

`PyUnio` is an implementation of Tolga Tezel's Node.js project [unio](https://github.com/ttezel/unio). 
 
It allows developers to consume REST API's in as little as three lines of code by predefining aspects of an API in a `JSON` file. These API definitions are called `Specifications` and should be placed in a directory titled `specs`.

Any `specs` should be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ttezel/unio/tree/master/specs) or you can write your own.

### Warning

`PyUnio`'s development may not always run parallel to that of `unio`. 

`PyUnio` may implement features not available in `unio`, or it may not implement features available in `unio`.

For this reason, you should __read this entire page__ for any important changes in future versions.

### Install

Either

	$ git clone git://github.com/citruspi/PyUnio.git
	$ cd PyUnio && python setup.py
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
or

	$ pip install pyunio
	
### Directory Structure

	project/
		script.py
		specs/
			service1.json
			service2.json
			service3.json			
			etc
	
### Usage

```python
from pyunio import pyunio

params = {
	'oauth': {
		'consumer_secret'	 : 'ITS A SECRET',
		'consumer_key'   	 : 'ITS A SECRET',
		'access_token'       : 'ITS A SECRET',
		'access_token_secret': 'ITS A SECRET'								
	},
	'header': {
		'api_key': 'ITS A SECRET'
	},
	'body': {
		'username': 'iluv',
		'password': 'pie'
	}
}
```

#### Example: Twitter - Get User Settings

The following code is an implementation of Twitter's API with PyUnio:

```python
from pyunio import pyunio
	
params = {
	'oauth':  {
		'consumer_secret'    : 'ITS A SECRET',
		'consumer_key'       : 'ITS A SECRET',
		'access_token'       : 'ITS A SECRET',
		'access_token_secret': 'ITS A SECRET'
	},
	'header': {},
	'body'  : {}
}
	
pyunio.use('twitter')
	
result = pyunio.get('account/settings', params)
print result.text
```

The output of `result.text` (with my Twitter account) is:

```python
{
	"protected":false,
	"geo_enabled":false,
	"screen_name":"citrus",
	"language":"en",
	"time_zone":{
		"tzinfo_name":"America\/Halifax",
		"name":"Atlantic Time (Canada)",
		"utc_offset":-14400
	},
	"discoverable_by_email":false,
	"sleep_time":{
		"enabled":false,
		"start_time":null,
		"end_time":null
	},
	"use_cookie_personalization":false,
	"always_use_https":true
}
```

This can then be loaded and parsed via Python's `JSON` module:

	parsed = json.loads(result.text)

### API

Coming Soon.
